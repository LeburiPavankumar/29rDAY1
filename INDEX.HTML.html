<h2><b>1.AMAZON</b></h2>

<h3>Amazon is an e-commerce platform that allows customers to buy products and services from a variety of categories: 
Shopping
Customers can search for products using the search bar or filters, add items to their cart, and check out using a virtual point-of-sale (POS) system. 
Marketplace
Third-party sellers can list new or used products on Amazon's marketplace, and Amazon customers can buy from them. 
Fulfillment by Amazon
Online sellers can use this service to send their inventory to Amazon Fulfillment centers, where Amazon specialists handle the shipping and delivery. 
Amazon is one of the largest e-commerce marketplaces in the world. It offers a wide range of products, including media, apparel, electronics, beauty products, groceries, health and personal care products, and more. Amazon also offers a membership-based service called Amazon Prime, which provides benefits like free two-day shipping, streaming, shopping, and reading. 

E-commerce platforms comprise of four types of online transactions:
1. Business to Consumer (B2C): It is the most common form of eCommerce business. In this model, you order your product on an eCommerce platform who then sends a notification to the seller, who then dispatches the product which is received by you. Anything the consumer buys online— their favourite pair of shoes, household appliances, books, dresses etc — all come under the Business to Consumer model.

Pro-tip: "Enriching customer experience would be of utmost importance here considering this model depends on it for it to be successful. An exclusive feel can help you with the same. Launching your business with an edge of exclusivity creates an urge within the customers to buy. Services like Amazon Accelerator essentially take care of such tasks for you to help you focus on the most important task - to sell better to your customers."

2. Business to Business (B2B) : When a business purchases goods or services online from another business then it is referred as Business to Business. Retailers who purchase their wholesale products online are one of the best examples of this type of e-commerce business. For example: Amazon also provides Business to Business services which can help you discover a faster and smarter way to do B2B buying online.

Did you know: According to a recent survey, 60% of B2B tech buyers in 2021 were millennials.

3. Consumer to Business (C2B): Many freelancers, designers, artists and photographers licence their art pieces to businesses for publishing. This online transaction of services from an individual to a business comes under C2B. Thus, under this model, businesses allow individuals to sell goods and services to companies. This business model is gaining popularity among the freelancers and work-from-home individuals who are offering their services to companies. Pexels is one such website which provides royalty free images and videos from creators.

4. Consumer to Consumer (C2C): Have you sold any of your things online to another customer? If yes, then you come under this category of eCommerce business. In this model, a consumer sells goods and services directly to another consumer. Imagine, you list an old camera on any eCommerce platform and another customer sees the product and buys it. This sort of transaction will fall under the C2C category. In this case, the eCommerce business will only charge a samll commission for using their website. OLX, Quikr are such websites which help in buying, selling, and exchanging products and services.

ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that uses natural language processing to create humanlike conversational dialogue. The language model can respond to questions and compose various written content, including articles, social media posts, essays, code and emails.

Uses of natural language processing.
These are some uses for natural language processing.
ChatGPT is a form of generative AI -- a tool that lets users enter prompts to receive humanlike images, text or videos that are created by AI.

ChatGPT is similar to the automated chat services found on customer service websites, as people can ask it questions or request clarification to ChatGPT's replies. The GPT stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer," which refers to how ChatGPT processes requests and formulates responses. ChatGPT is trained with reinforcement learning through human feedback and reward models that rank the best responses. This feedback helps augment ChatGPT with machine learning to improve future responses.

Who created ChatGPT?
OpenAI -- an artificial intelligence research company -- created ChatGPT and launched the tool in November 2022. It was founded by a group of entrepreneurs and researchers including Elon Musk and Sam Altman in 2015. OpenAI is backed by several investors, with Microsoft being the most notable. OpenAI also created Dall-E, an AI text-to-art generator.

AI has been the focus of my life's work, as for many of my research colleagues. Ever since programming AI for computer games as a teenager, and throughout my years as a neuroscience researcher trying to understand the workings of the brain, I’ve always believed that if we could build smarter machines, we could harness them to benefit humanity in incredible ways.

This promise of a world responsibly empowered by AI continues to drive our work at Google DeepMind. For a long time, we’ve wanted to build a new generation of AI models, inspired by the way people understand and interact with the world. AI that feels less like a smart piece of software and more like something useful and intuitive — an expert helper or assistant.

Today, we’re a step closer to this vision as we introduce Gemini, the most capable and general model we’ve ever built.

Gemini is the result of large-scale collaborative efforts by teams across Google, including our colleagues at Google Research. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means it can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image and video.

n October 2013, Duolingo launched a crowdsourced language incubator.[48] In March 2021, it announced that it would be ending its volunteer contributor program and donating money to its volunteer contributors who helped develop it. The company said that from now on, language courses would be maintained and developed by professional linguists aligning with CEFR standards.[49] On June 28, 2021, Duolingo filed for an initial public offering on NASDAQ under the ticker DUOL.[50] From August 2021 to June 2022, the Duolingo language learning app was removed from some app stores in China.[51] In the early 2020s, Duolingo was noted for its viral videos on the social media platform TikTok.[52][53]

In August 2022, Duolingo overhauled its interface, changing its course structure from a tree-like design, where users could choose from a range of lessons after completing previous ones, to a linear progression. This update has been criticized by users across social media outlets, such as Reddit and Twitter.[20] CEO Luis von Ahn stated that there were no plans to reverse the changes—intended to simplify Duolingo for its new users—maintaining both the old and new versions would be difficult.[54] In October 2022, Duolingo acquired Detroit-based animation studio Gunner; it is the studio that produces art assets and animation for Duolingo and Duolingo ABC and its marketing campaigns.

In March 2023, Duolingo officially announced the planned Duolingo Max, a subscription tier above Super Duolingo, in their blog.[55] In July 2023, Duolingo launched a feature using the iOS widget feature. In October 2023, Duolingo released math and music courses in English and Spanish for iOS users.[56][57]

In October Duolingo introduced Duolingo Score.
On Duolingo, learners learn by engaging with the language. Users complete lessons using words they are learning. Duolingo uses a gamified approach to language learning, with lessons that incorporate translating, interactive exercises, quizzes, and stories.
